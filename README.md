# Projet_2_Mood_in_Music

Here is my 2nd project done after 2 months at wild code school with 2 of my classmates.

We used the MVC model under agile method with 4 one-week sprints.

This site is offered to people who love music, we offer a list of royalty-free music, as well as a voting system allowing users (when the vote is launched by an administrator) to make their choice to elect their best music. A ranking page displays user votes in real time.

Feel free to clone to test!
